Some notes on how to use python. Written for Python 3.

These notes assume some basic programming knowledge. Started as Python intro for my peers at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/).

Each note is in it's own folder. Read readme inside a folder for folder specific info.

List of somewhat finished notes:

1. venv: creating virtual environments for python
2. jupyter: python + markdown = <3

## TODO

- [ ] Start using python as better calculator right now!
- [ ] Python versions
	+ Is Python 2 still a thing?
	+ What are the differences between versions?
	+ Which python is installed on my computer?
- [ ] What is a variable?
	+ do you pass by value, by reference or by pointer?
	+ why making mutable default parameter value is a bad idea
	+ why `[[0]*n]*n]` is a bad idea
	+ yes, you can pass functions around
	+ and classes
- [ ] packing, unpacking, iterating
	+ `a, *b, c = map(int, input().split())`
	+ `print(*[x for x in b if x > 0])`
	+ itertools
- [ ] replacing bash with python (plumbum)
